*********************************
Known Issues (Pending Validation)
*********************************

Below is a list of known bugs.  Items will be removed as they are addressed by future STIPS updates.

* The orientation of the image is non-standard, with east pointing to the right of the image. The relative position of sources is not affected.

* There exists a function to place extended sources given a set of sersic parameters, but its validity and functionality have not been tested.

* The flux measurements of sources are only validated in the absence of noise/background. As such, the net flux of the image may be inaccurate.

* STIPS interpolates 9 PSFs generated by WebbPSF across the detector to the location of the source being placed. However, there is currently a
  known offset of 20 pixels (in both the X and Y directions) between the location at which the PSF is interpolated, and the location at which the
  target is displayed. **NOTE** that this does not affect the target position or centre on the detector, it only means that, if a point source 
  is created with a position of (x, y), it will be placed at location (x, y) but the interpolated PSF shape will be the shape of the PSF at 
  location (x+20, y+20). Because the WFI PSF shape does not vary strongly over this distance, the effect is minimal and should not be a concern
  for most science cases. If ultra-precise PSF models are required, the user should generate them directly with WebbPSF at the desired pixel
  location.

* Bright sources will have large diffraction spikes that are visible beyond 22 pixels away from the center of the source. A “bright_limit” and 
  “xbright_limit” (extra-bright limit) magnitude can be specified –– objects brighter than this threshold will be computed out to a radius of 44 
  (bright) and 88 (extra-bright) pixels, respectively. Note that, because point source flux is computed for every pixel, bright targets will take
  roughly 4 times as long (and extra-bright sources 16 times as long) to compute as standard sources, so these limits should only be set when
  it matters.
