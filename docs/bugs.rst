*********************************
Known Issues (Pending Validation)
*********************************

Below is a list of known bugs.  Items will be removed as they are addressed by future STIPS updates.

* The orientation of the image is non-standard, with east pointing to the right of the image. The relative position of sources is not affected.

* There exists a function to place extended sources given a set of sersic parameters, but its validity and functionality have not been tested.

* The flux measurements of sources are only validated in the absence of noise/background. As such, the net flux of the image may be inaccurate.

* STIPS interpolates 9 PSFs generated by WebbPSF across the detector to the location of the source being placed. The accuracy of the PSF shape interpolation is accurate to within ~20 pixels. This effect is minimal and should not be cause for concern for most science cases. If ultra-precise PSF models are required, the user should generate them directly with WebbPSF at the desired pixel location.

* Bright sources will have large diffraction spikes that are not computed beyond 22 pixels away from the center of the source. A “bright_limit” and “xbright_limit” magnitude can be specified –– objects brighter than this threshold will be computed out to a radius of 44 and 66 pixels, respectively.
